Supplementary Code for Moldovan & Elkrewi et al. 

This repository included all the scripts and commands used in the analysis for Moldovan & Elkrewi et al. If anything is missing or not clear, please do not hesitate to reach out to us, and we will do out best to fix the issue or clarify.

Below is a rough guide to the content of each folder:

Kmer analysis: This folder includes a flowchart that explains the generic k-mer pipeline we implemented and used to detect and assemble W-transcripts from male and female DNA and RNA sequencing data. It also includes the list of libraries used for the kmer analysis in both species, S. mansoni and S. japonicum, and the implementation of the kmer pipeline with those libraries. In addition to that, the config files and the commands used to assemble the output of the kmer pipeline can be found there.
