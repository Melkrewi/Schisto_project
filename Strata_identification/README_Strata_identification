### 4.1 De novo determination of Z-specific regions in S. mansoni 

# 1.bowtie2_mansoni.sh script needs as inputs: male and female DNA reads + fasta file of the reference genome

# 2.soapcov_mansoni.sh script needs as inputs: sam outputs of script 1 + fasta file of the reference genome

# InputFile1_Smansoni_SoapCov_By10kb_ForR_NewG.csv (i.e. modified output from script2) is used as input for the STEP1 of the R script titled 3.Zregions_Smansoni.R

# InputFile2_Zonly_10kb.txt is the output of STEP1, and is used as input for the STEP2 of the R script titled 3.Zregions_Smansoni.R

# InputFile3_windows-to-exclude.csv is used as input for the script titled 4.GeneSelector.pl    

# InputFile4_mansoni-gene-coordinates.csv is used as input for the script titled 4.GeneSelector.pl 

### 4.2 Inference of the location of  S. japonicum scaffolds along the S. mansoni Z-chromosome

# 5.blat.sh script needs as inputs: the CDS of S. mansoni as fasta file + the genome of S. japonicum as fasta file

# 6.besthitblat.pl script needs as inputs: the output of script 5, sorted by scaffold name (column 10)

# 7.blatreverse.pl script needs as inputs: the output of script 6, sorted by target name (column 14)

# 8.Figure1.R script needs as inputs: InputFile5_Smansoni_SoapCov_By10kb_ForR_NewG_onlyZW.csv + Dataset4_ZW_pairs_dNdS_with_strata_assignments_mansoni.csv + InputFile6_Sjaponicum_coverage_FST.csv + Dataset4_ZW_pairs_dNdS_with_strata_assignments_japonicum.csv + Dataset6_S_jap_Genome_Fst
